## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries) - email with enquiry is sent to mailbox via Gmail API

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass for stylesheets
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JS library
- [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides) - For sending enquiries to mail box


### What I learned

While working on this project I've improved my skills in working with Sass extension for stylesheets. Also a bit of a challenge was creating proper backgrounds through the page, working with relative/absolute positionaning 'of elements.

But the main achievement was usage of Gmail SMTP service to send enquiries from the form to mail box!
